# IQA_Inspired_Deep_Tone_Mapping
The Tensorflow implementation of paper "Deep Tone-mapping Operator Using Image Quality Assessment Inspired Semi-supervised Learning".  
We are making the code more concise and easier to read.  
Realeasing soon...  
If you just need a result to assess our method, you can send me your test set.
